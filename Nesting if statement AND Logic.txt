#The reason for nesting is when we have to evaluate for logics AND, OR 
#AND logic gets executed when nesting the True value. This procedure works for all computer languages
#and Spreadsheet conditional statement
#Nesting if statement executing AND logic, example-1
#if test>=70 AND final>=90 you passed
